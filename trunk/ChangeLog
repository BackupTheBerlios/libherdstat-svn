ChangeLog for libherdstat

2005-10-06 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: first release, 0.1.0_beta1.
	* herdstat/portage/herds_xml.cc: Catch the possibly thrown
	FileException if a projectxml file we try to parse doesn't exist.
	This caused parsing to cease fully, meaning we get invalid results for
	other missing stuff as well.

2005-10-05 Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org>

	* herdstat/util/functional.hh, herdstat/util/glob.hh,
	herdstat/util/regex.hh: Move regexMatch and patternMatch functors to
	functional.hh.

	* herdstat/: broke libherdstat out from herdstat into its own package.
	* doc/Doxyfile.in: Update so manual pages are generated.
