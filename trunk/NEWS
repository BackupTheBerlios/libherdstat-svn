0.1.0_beta2:
    Removed util::getcols() and thus the ncurses checks, linking, etc.

	New features:
	 - Added an interface to architecture keywords.  Provides a Keyword class
	   that represents a single architecture keyword.  Also provides a Keyword
	   container, Keywords, that besides holding keywords, is able to produce a
	   sorted, colored (if desired) keywords string.

0.1.0_beta1:
    Broke out libherdstat from herdstat proper into its own package.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed uncaught exception thrown when a projectxml file doesnt exist when
       parsing herds.xml that caused parsing to cease before finished.  Thanks
       to Diego (Flameeyes) for catching this one.
