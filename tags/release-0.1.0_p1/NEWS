This file contains a summary of changes in released versions.  Please read the
ChangeLog file for a more detailed listing of changes/bug fixes.

0.1.0_p1:
    - Removed util::getcols() and thus the ncurses checks, linking, etc.
    - Rewrote portage::config class.  It can no longer be used directly
      (private constructor) and instead can only be access via
      portage::GlobalConfig(), which returns a const reference to a local
      static instance.
    - util::BaseFileObject now defines read() and close(), calling pure
      virtuals, do_read() and do_close() respectively.

    New features:
	- Added an interface to architecture keywords.  Provides a Keyword
	  class that represents a single architecture keyword.  Also provides
	  a Keyword container, Keywords, that besides holding keywords, is
	  able to produce a sorted, colored (if desired) keywords string.
	- Added a few more function objects: portage::IsCategory,
	  util::First{Less,Greater}, util::Second{Less,Greater}.

0.1.0_beta1:
    Broke out libherdstat from herdstat proper into its own package.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed uncaught exception thrown when a projectxml file doesnt exist when
       parsing herds.xml that caused parsing to cease before finished.  Thanks
       to Diego (Flameeyes) for catching this one.
